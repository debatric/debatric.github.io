I am committed to making astrophysics accessible—especially the story of how we **detect and interpret gravitational waves** and connect them to what we “see” across the electromagnetic spectrum (radio pulsars, X-ray binaries, and other multi-messenger signals). I enjoy speaking with broad audiences, collaborating with communicators, and building inclusive scientific communities.

## Leadership, teaching & impact

### Teaching & mentorship
I have tutored undergraduate physics and astronomy courses and consistently received highly positive feedback. I care deeply about fostering an engaging, supportive, and inclusive learning environment—especially for students who may be new to research culture or under-represented in STEM.

### Student advocacy & academic leadership
During my PhD, I was elected to serve as **Student Representative and Council Member of the Astronomical Society of Australia (ASA)**. In this role, I advocated for students’ needs and helped implement initiatives that improved their academic experience. At **Cardiff University**, I organised seminar series to promote scholarly exchange and strengthen departmental community.

### Climate leadership & global perspective
In **November 2023**, I voyaged to **Antarctica** as part of **Homeward Bound**, an international leadership initiative empowering women in STEM to drive action on climate change. This transformative experience strengthened my commitment to advancing science in service of a sustainable and equitable future.

### Writing & representation
With astronomer **Isobel Romero-Shaw**, I co-authored the book **_Women in Physics_** (ISBN-10: 0645041122), written to inspire the next generation through relatable role models and to broaden who feels they belong in science.

### Professional community roles
I am a member of the **Royal Astronomical Society** and the **LIGO Scientific Collaboration**, an alumnus of the **ARC Centre of Excellence for Gravitational Wave Discovery (OzGrav)**, and a **SkAI Associate with Chicago AstroAI**, reflecting my growing engagement at the interface of astrophysics and artificial intelligence.
