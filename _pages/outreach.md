I’m passionate about making astrophysics accessible—especially the story of how we **detect and interpret gravitational waves** and connect them to what we “see” across the electromagnetic spectrum (radio pulsars, X-ray binaries, and other multi-messenger signals). I enjoy speaking with broad audiences, collaborating with science communicators, and supporting initiatives that broaden participation in STEM.
