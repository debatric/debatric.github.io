## Beyond research

Life outside the "mad scientist" role is powered by rhythm, curiosity, and a stubborn refusal to fit into neat boxes.

I am **trained classical Indian dancer in Manipuri**, dance began at **age 4** and never really stopped. Rooted in the **Nāṭyaśāstra** tradition, it’s part discipline, part joy—storytelling through movement, expression, and music. It is also a quiet act of rebellion: being fully scientific *and* fully artistic, without having to choose.

Travel is another kind of classroom—collecting stories from cities, mountains, museums, train stations, and night markets; noticing how history, culture, and everyday life weave together in surprising ways.

Books are the constant thread: **Bengali and English classics**, **sci-fi**, and **narrative non-fiction**—the kind that leaves you thinking long after the last page.
