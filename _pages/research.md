## Research snapshot
I study how **massive stars form, evolve, and interact in binaries**, and how these pathways lead to **compact object (black hole/neutron star) mergers**. My work links uncertain binary evolution physics and **dense stellar environments** (including N-body dynamics of star clusters) to the populations observed in **gravitational wave catalogs** and **electromagnetic surveys**.

## Current themes
- **Compact binaries & populations:** formation channels, merger rates, and observable demographics (mass, spin, eccentricity)
- **Pulsars & neutron-star astrophysics:** connecting radio/X-ray pulsar populations to evolutionary pathways
- **Multi-messenger connections:** what joint GW + EM constraints reveal about compact objects
- **Massive black holes:** intermediate-mass black holes and their signatures in **globular clusters** and **nuclear star clusters**
- **Open, reusable tools:** code + data products that enable reproducible population studies
