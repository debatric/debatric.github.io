I study how **massive stars form, evolve, and interact in binaries**, and how these pathways lead to **compact object (black hole/neutron star) mergers**. My work links uncertain binary evolution physics and **dense stellar environments** (including N-body dynamics of star clusters) to the populations observed in **gravitational wave catalogs** and **electromagnetic surveys**.

I am strongly committed to teaching and mentoring students from diverse backgrounds. To date, I have co-supervised two PhD students and supervised two Master’s students, and I aim to create an engaging, supportive, and inclusive learning environment.

## Current themes
- **Compact binaries & populations:** formation channels, merger rates, and observable demographics (mass, spin, eccentricity)
- **Pulsars & neutron-star astrophysics:** connecting radio/X-ray pulsar populations to evolutionary pathways
- **Multi-messenger connections:** what joint GW + EM constraints reveal about compact objects
- **Massive black holes:** intermediate-mass black holes and their signatures in **globular clusters** and **nuclear star clusters**
- **Open, reusable tools:** code + data products that enable reproducible population studies

## Recognition, invited talks & professional service
My contributions have been recognized with several distinctions and invitations, including:
- **2020 HDR Outstanding Article Award** (PhD) and commendations for postgraduate awards at Swinburne University of Technology  
- Nominations for major thesis prizes (including the **Charlene Heisler Prize** and **Iain Wallace Research Medal**)  
- Scientific service including a **Scientific Organizing Committee** role for a gravitational-wave session at **National Astronomy Meeting 2023**  
- Participation in a workshop at the **Aspen Center for Physics**  
- Invited presentations including a **HEAD seminar at the Center for Astrophysics, Harvard & Smithsonian**  
- Invited speaker at **King’s College London** during the **Higgs Lecture (Dame Jocelyn Bell)** and the workshop *“New Physics with Neutron Stars”*  
- Invited talk at **IAU Symposium 398 & MODEST-25** (including proceedings contribution)  
- Panellist on the **NSF–Simons SkAI@REACH Outreach Panel** on AI in Astrophysics (July 2025)

In **2024**, I had the extraordinary honour of serving as **Master of Ceremony at the 73rd Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting**, representing the **Royal Astronomical Society**—the first time this role was offered to a young scientist. This remains one of the most meaningful moments of my career: helping shape a global scientific conversation at the highest level.
My work and service have been recognized through multiple honours and invitations, including the **2020 HDR Outstanding Article Award** and commendations for postgraduate awards. I’ve also contributed to the community through conference organization and invited talks (refer to CV, and Outreach for YouTube/SoundCloud/KITP links).

I have organized seminar series to foster departmental exchange, and served in academic leadership roles—including being elected as **Student Representative and Council Member of the Astronomical Society of Australia (ASA)**, where I advocated for student needs and implemented initiatives to improve the student experience.
