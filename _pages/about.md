I’m **Debatri Chattopadhyay**, a theoretical and computational astrophysicist fascinated by the most extreme objects in the Universe—**neutron stars and black holes**. I study how we can *“listen”* to their lives through **gravitational waves**, and *“see”* them through **radio pulsars** and other **multi-messenger** signals. I combine modelling with open, reusable tools to connect theory with data, and I love sharing these stories with broader audiences through public outreach.

Outside of research, you’ll usually find me **dancing**, **reading novels**, or **travelling**.

## Research snapshot
I study how **massive stars form, evolve, and interact in binaries**, and how these pathways lead to **compact-object mergers**. My work links the uncertain physics of **binary evolution** and **dense stellar environments** (including N-body dynamics of star clusters) to the populations observed in **gravitational-wave catalogs** and **electromagnetic surveys**.

**Current themes**
- **Compact binaries & populations:** formation channels, merger rates, and observable demographics (mass, spin, and eccentricity)
- **Pulsars & neutron star astrophysics:** connecting radio/X-ray pulsar populations to evolutionary pathways
- **Multi-messenger connections:** what joint GW + EM constraints reveal about compact objects
- **Massive black holes:** intermediate-mass black holes and their signatures in **globular clusters** and **nuclear star clusters**
- **Open, reusable tools:** code + data products that enable reproducible population studies
