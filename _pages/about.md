I’m **Debatri Chattopadhyay**, a theoretical and computational astrophysicist fascinated by the most extreme objects in the Universe—**neutron stars and black holes**. I study how we can *“listen”* to their lives through **gravitational waves**, and *“see”* them through **radio pulsars** and other **multi-messenger** signals. I combine modelling with open, reusable tools to connect theory with data, and I love sharing these stories with broader audiences through public outreach.

Outside of research, you’ll usually find me **dancing**, **reading novels**, or **travelling**.

## Beyond research: leadership, mentorship & outreach
I’m strongly committed to mentorship, teaching, and building scientific communities. I’ve taught and tutored undergraduate physics and astronomy (with consistently excellent feedback), organized seminar series to foster departmental exchange, and served in academic leadership roles—including being elected as **Student Representative and Council Member of the Astronomical Society of Australia (ASA)**, where I advocated for student needs and implemented initiatives to improve the student experience.

My work and service have been recognized through multiple honours and invitations, including the **2020 HDR Outstanding Article Award** and commendations for postgraduate awards. I’ve also contributed to the community through conference organization and invited talks, and in **2024** I had the extraordinary honour of serving as **Master of Ceremony at the 73rd Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting**, representing the **Royal Astronomical Society**—the first time this role was offered to a young scientist.
