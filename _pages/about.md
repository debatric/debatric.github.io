I am **Debatri Chattopadhyay**, a theoretical and computational astrophysicist fascinated by the most extreme objects in the Universe—**neutron stars and black holes**. I study how we can *“listen”* to their lives through **gravitational waves**, and *“see”* them through **radio pulsars** and other **multi-messenger** signals. I combine modelling with open, reusable tools to connect theory with data, and I love sharing these stories with broader audiences through public outreach.

I am originally from Calcutta, India, and my journey has taken me across four countries: a PhD in Melbourne (Australia), postdoctoral research in Cardiff (UK), and now life and research in Chicago (USA).

Curiosity and adventure are at the core of who I am. I care deeply about challenging stereotypes—especially for women and people of colour in science—and helping more people feel that they belong in STEM. I am inspired by the wonder and bold imagination of Jules Verne, and love sharing the excitement of discovery with wider audiences.

Outside of research, you’ll usually find me **dancing**, **reading novels**, or **travelling**.
